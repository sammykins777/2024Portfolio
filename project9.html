      <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of web design, finding the right platform for your portfolio can be trial and error. Dissatisfied with the lack of value from a pricey drag-and-drop editor, I set out on a mission to craft a free, simple, and custom website using the power of DIY and ChatGPT.

      </p>
      <p>The previous design fell short, failing to deliver the value I sought. Determined to make a change, my objective for the redesign was clear: a nearly free and straightforward custom site that truly reflected me and my work.</p>
      <p>Little redesign occurred as I turned to ChatGPT for a head start. With its assistance, I received a basic template code for a portfolio, a foundation to build upon. Time was of the essence, and ChatGPT not only accelerated the coding process but also played a role in fine-tuning the website's copy.</p>
      <p>The journey taught me a valuable lesson: investing a bit of upfront effort to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can save both time and money. Embracing free technology resources proved to be a game-changer, making web development more accessible and cost-effective.</p>
      <p>The new design stands as a truer representation of me and my work. It not only showcases front-end development skills but also highlights graphic and animation design. More importantly, it illustrates my ability to stretch a dollar by rolling up my sleeves, learning as needed, and utilizing low-cost resources.</p>
      <p>In the quest for a functional website, I struck a balance by refraining from reinventing the wheel. Retaining elements from the previous design ensured a functional and efficient website without unnecessary complications.</p>
      <p>My portfolio redesign journey taught me that there are various paths to achieving your goals. While fast and professional solutions may come with a hefty price tag, opting for something fast and 'good enough' can be both cost-effective and rewarding. The key lies in leveraging available resources wisely, a lesson that has transformed not just my website but my approach to web development as a whole.</p>
